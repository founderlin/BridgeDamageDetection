# Bridge Damage Detection

## Introduction

The codes serve for structural analysis using finite element method (FEM). Bernoulli beam elements are utilized to establish a numerical bridge model. Parallel simulation package is embedded in the current Julia release. This research work adopts this package in to verify the proposed bridge damage detection. 

In the current version, three different loss functions are considered for a comparative study. 

The results of a previous code version, where only one loss function is applied, is published in the conference proceeding CIB W78 2019 [1], and the conference paper was invited to be extent and published in the journal Automation in Construction [2].
